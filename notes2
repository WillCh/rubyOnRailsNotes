MVC MODEL VIEW AND CONTROLER

controller connect the db
model how to interate with data
view how to genearte and show the data

config= configureation care about routes.rb definition how the route be

rails console
open the jieshiqi (based on rails)

ruby: if just type fun name then fun is called... 
like$ foo

exit => exit the interprator
#________________ end of the ruby__________

rails server: start the server on local pc localhost + port#

usually open the server run and let another editor to run

rails server -p 4000

compile some js and html to send to custorand let browser to run

rails new lect1// generate a new rails application

put html in the ./app/view


mkdir pages

make a page home.html.erb // erb is ruby thing 

just a new page then how to get the page
router is in config/locals/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
	get "home", to: "pages#home"
 # when we post a requst home then router ask the pages#home controller run, call home in the controller 
then the controller call home and home fun find the home.html.erb to send to the broswer
# before # is the folder in the pages, after # then html file in this folder. also call the home in the pages controller

end


in app/controllers/concerns/ build pages_controller.rb

create a class PagesController <ApplicationController
// here 

# in this class we define the method to match the
# get "xx", to: pages#yyy


root "pages#home" # then make home.html.rbl to be default home then don;t need def home


if we just build number.html.erb then def five/six

if we call it can't find number.html

but if we add render "number" then it can find the correct template 


in ruby x = 5, then "Hi #{x} " == Hi 5; thus {} just for get the val of the variable


.erb means embedded ruby

then html can be run ruby 


in it we can use <%= @xxxx%> @xxxx get from the def fun

<%=%> will show the value
<%%> will run the ruby code inside
